# WSO2 Serververless Test Actions

WSO2 Serverless Solution is a private FaaS deployment which allows the developers to easily deploy their code as functions while leveraging their existing event sources and the power of programming languages such as Ballerina.

Actions are stateless functions that run on the WSO2 Serverless Solution. In this example, we will work with a built-in sample JAVA and JS action.
